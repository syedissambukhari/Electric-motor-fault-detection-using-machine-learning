## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

We utilize the KNN algorithm for fault detection due to its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks. KNN works by classifying data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors in feature space.

## Results Interpretation

The results obtained from the KNN model can be interpreted based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves provide insights into the model's performance.

## Future Improvements

- Explore other machine learning algorithms for fault detection.
- Enhance the dataset with additional features and samples.
- Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Deploy the model in real-world applications for continuous monitoring.
